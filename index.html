                        <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a federal agency dedicated to ensuring that
                            markets for consumer financial products and services are fair, transparent, and
                            competitive. To support this mission, technologists at the CFPB build external
                            resources for the public and internal tools to help the Bureau run more efficiently.
